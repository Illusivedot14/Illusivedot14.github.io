        Make sure that you're <u style="color:red">AT LEAST</u><span style="color:#FFD700"> Level 100</span> 
        before approaching this boss as you will get no loot if you're below that threshold. Also if you're not being carried, 
        have at least Demon Lord level gear before attempting to make your life easier.
        <br>
        <br> 
        To find this boss, just go into the Deep Forest in the Spirit Forest West of Prius (Teleport 9).</p>

        This is your first Mid boss, it is also the easiest Mid boss. One of your main concerns is dodging his Ethereal Strike/Spirit Echo and blocking the Drain Orbs from reaching him, like with Mana Ancient. 
        This boss is straight forward until he reaches <span style="color:#90EE90">50% HP</span>, where he will use Heaven's Wrath. 
        <br><br></p>

        <p class="guide-overall-description">
        <br>
        After <span style="color:#90EE90">50% HP</span>, he will gain <span style="color:#FFFF99">25% Damage Reduction</span> and his Ethereal Strike will travel a second time after reaching its maximum range. This part is the same as before except he's a little bit tankier. 
        Mind your positioning due to the Spirit Flames and you'll get this boss down in no time.</p>
