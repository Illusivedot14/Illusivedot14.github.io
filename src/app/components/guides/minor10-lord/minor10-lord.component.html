            Make sure that you're <u style="color:red">AT LEAST</u><span style="color:#FFD700"> Level 90</span> 
            before approaching this boss as you will get no experience nor loot if you're below that threshold.

            This boss is within the lair during the Expedition Scenario. To summon this boss, get 6 Blue Stones from either the deposits at the Cave Entrance (Teleport 4) if you have an Abyssal Pickaxe or 
            above, or the blue stone deposits at Frosty Snowfield (Teleport 6). Then, talk to the captain of the expedition at Frosty Snowfield, and bring the stones to the circle surrounded 
            by 3 Prius Magus. See Soul of Everfrost or Frostspider Queen to see how to deal with the waves.</p>

            This boss is extremely tanky for a Minor and has the first insta-kill mechanic in the game. Due to his Hellfrost Body, you will take periodic damage no matter where 
            you are in the Lair. Frostspider Lord can only cast his spells whenever he has full mana, or once every 4 seconds. You'll only have to worry about Ice Storm and Frozen 
            Shatter as webbing is pretty weak.
            <br>
            <br>
            At 66% and 33% HP, he will cast his Frozen Barrier, which is a shield that makes up about 10% of his HP. You can either wait it out, break it with a break spell, or deal enough damage 
            to break it. He'll freeze you when its over but it's nothing to worry about. After this, he will gain access to Frozen Shatter. When he uses Frozen Shatter, make sure you dont stand in front of him and 
            keep moving to the side as that's the best way to avoid it. Keep going until he is dead.</p>
