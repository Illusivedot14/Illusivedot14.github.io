            Make sure that you're <u style="color:red">AT LEAST</u><span style="color:#FFD700"> Level 100</span> 
            before approaching this boss as you will get no loot if you're below that threshold. Also if you're not being carried, 
            have at least Mid level gear before attempting to make your life easier, from this point on, you need a party.
            <br>
            <br> 
            To find this boss, you need to get a Seal Breaking Gem, which can be obtained by the Mana Ancient in the Fairy Forest (Teleport 9) or the Spirit Beast in the Deep Forest at the same area. 
            You will also need a Green Stone gotten from the Fairy Forest or in the stone deposit at the Cave Entrance (Teleport 4) if you have an abyssal pick. Enter the circle at the statue north 
            of Fairy Forest and place the Seal Breaking Gem on the circle in front of a dormant Ancient Ent to start the fight.</p>

            This boss is the easiest High boss, but it is also the easiest to mess up if you're not careful. This boss has a lot of avenues to heal itself, and if it gets to full once triggering 
            its phase, it will reset and lower drop rates considerably.
            <br>
            <br>
            Starting off, the Ancient Ent itself isn't a large issue. It only has access to two whole spells throughout the fight, both relatively easy to dodge. Just get it down 
            to 50%, where it will cast "Fortitude of Nature". This is where the real fight begins.</p>

            Once this spell is activated, two Elder Giants will rise from the ground, taking 4 seconds to fully get up. These giants will have three spells you'll have to worry about but the most 
            important ones are Thorns Armor, Blessing of Nature and Might of Nature. <span style="color: red;">MAKE SURE THESE GUYS STAY AWAY FROM EACH OTHER AND ANCIENT ENT.</span> Blessing of Nature 
            will garuantee a reset if these guys are near anyone. Other than that, position yourselves well (even if it means dying, re-entry is free), to keep Elder Ents away. Pay attention. </p>

                After at least one of these Elder Ents are dead, they will spawn 5 Giant Ents, these guys are just filler. Kill the other Elder Ent and finish off Ancient Ent for your loot.</p>
