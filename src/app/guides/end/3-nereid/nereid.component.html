            Make sure that you're <u style="color:red">AT LEAST</u><span style="color:#FFD700"> Level 100</span> 
            before approaching this boss AND at least <b><u>high-level geared</u></b> before approaching this boss, the difficulty will ramp up dramatically from here on out.
            <br>
            <br> 
            To get to this boss, first gather <span style="color:#b19cd9">3 Chaos Magic Stones</span> from killing <span style="color:#b19cd9">Chaos Elementals</span> in front of the 
            Elemental Tower <span style="color:#FFD700">(Teleport Q-2)</span> which is also below Golem Cave <span style="color:#FFD700">(Teleport 4)</span>, or if you have an 
            <span style="color:#52E252">Chaos Pickaxe</span>, you can mine directly from the Stone Deposit inside the tower <span style="color:#FFD700">(Teleport Q-2)</span>.  You'll also need 3 White Stones from 
            either the Deposits at the Cave Entrance <span style="color:#FFD700">(Teleport 4)</span> if you have an 
            <span style="color:#52E252">Abyssal Pickaxe</span> or above, or the White Stone Deposits at the Duchy of Wallachia <span style="color:#FFD700">(Teleport 7)</span>.
            Then bring the stones to the tinkerer in the center of the tower and craft the <span [style.color]='enemy.color'>Key of Storms</span>, 
            then bring it to the left-most teleport to enter <span [style.color]='enemy.color'>Valtora's Room</span>.</p>

            This boss is the most straight-forward out of the Tower bosses as it only has one intermission phase. For this boss, you'll need consistent healing, two tanky people and at least one person who doesn't mind being far apart.
            <br>
            <br>
            To start the fight, have one of the tanks hit Valtora. They will be marked with <span [style.color]='enemy.color'>Magnetic Attraction</span>, which will bind the closest person, in this case, the other tank. These two will be 
            bound together till death to them part. If the marked person dies, the next person who attacks Valtora will be marked, if the bound person dies, they will pull everyone in the room towards him until a person is close enough to be 
            linked. SO DON'T DIE IF YOU'RE LINKED.</p>

            Another mechanic to keep track of are the blue balls that will travel around the arena. DO NOT TOUCH THEM. They will apply the debuff Nasty Shock which is the main killer in this fight. Try to either avoid or mitigate damage.</p>

            The boss will have two spells in the first half. Storm Hammer will target the furthest person within 1300 range, which is generally around the middle of the arena from where Valtora starts. Have one person or a summon soak 
            the Hammer (Priest summon Raguel will get no damage from Hammer). 
            The other spell, Servant of Lightning, will summon 2 smaller Minions which will grant both minions and Valtora a Lightning Shield. 
            These shields will reduce damage to Valtora by 50% and make every attack by the Servants interrupt. These shields can be broken. </p>

            Keep attacking the boss and avoiding the blue orbs until 50%, where he will begin the intermission phase. Valtora will fly to the sky and four Tornados will appear in each quadrant. Split your team so that a healer can reach 
            as many people as possible while also being on a Tornado. A rule of thumb is that the 2 linked people will go on one Tornado while everyone will split onto the other Tornados. These Tornados will hurt and will silence you so don't get 
            on it with Nasty Shock applied or else you'll kill your whole team. Valtora will then summon 3 red lines to sweep across the arena. THESE LINES WILL INSTA-KILL YOU. The only way to dodge them is if you're above them.

            After the intermission, he will gain 30% Damage Reduction, Storm Hammer will now spawn a lightning pool that will heal the boss, and he will gain a new spell which will summon one line. 
            ALWAYS BAIT THESE SPELL OUT BEFORE ENGAGING. It will be the first spell he'll cast if the other spells are on cooldown. 
            After those spell are baited, you can continue to attack him until he is dead. However he will cast his new spell when its off cooldown.
