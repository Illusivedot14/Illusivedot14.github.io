            Make sure that you're <u style="color:red">AT LEAST</u><span style="color:#FFD700"> Level 100</span> 
            before approaching this boss as you'll get no loot if you're below that threshold. Also if you're not being carried, 
            have at least SK, ZL, or AE level gear before attempting to make your life easier, you need a party.
            <br>
            <br> 
            To summon this boss, you must kill Guardian Angels from the <span style="color:#FFD700">Avalon Scenario</span> and 
            stop the summoning. You will need 7 White Stones from 
            either the Deposits at the Cave Entrance <span style="color:#FFD700">(Teleport 4)</span> if you have an 
            <span style="color:#52E252">Abyssal Pickaxe</span> or above, or the White Stone Deposits at the Duchy of Wallachia 
            <span style="color:#FFD700">(Teleport 7)</span>. Complete 
            the <span style="color:#FFD700">Avalon Scenario</span> and you should have 3 White Stones left to summon 
            <span [style.color]='enemy.color'>Archangel Samael</span>. Make sure everyone is inside the room, because it locks the room. <span style="color:#FF6666">There are no do-overs if 
            you fail the boss, so don't fail</span>.</p>

            This is the most punishing out of all the High bosses as every single spell will help recovery in some way or form. Unlike the other bosses, <span [style.color]='enemy.color'>Samael</span> is actually the most simple.
            <br>
            <br>
            He'll first start off with his two spells, <span [style.color]='enemy.color'>Focused Light</span> and <span [style.color]='enemy.color'>Order of Light</span>. Make sure the person with <span [style.color]='enemy.color'>Focused Light</span> moves away from the group and <span [style.color]='enemy.color'>Samael</span> so none of you get hit by the 
            splash of light. Don't stand in <span [style.color]='enemy.color'>Order of Light</span>, at all. <span [style.color]='enemy.color'>Samael</span> will heal for every person inside it. Past <span style="color:#90EE90">85% Max HP</span>, he'll use the <span [style.color]='enemy.color'>Protection of Light</span> spell, 
            which grants him <span style="color:#FFFF99">25% Damage Reduction</span> and <span style="color:#90EE90">1% max HP regen</span>. <span style="color:#FF6666">Break it ASAP if you can</span>. 
            <br>
            <br>
            At <span style="color:#90EE90">66% max HP</span>, he'll use <span [style.color]='enemy.color'>Judgment</span>. Which has you dodging 6 patterns of light of various patterns. 
            An easy way to dodge them, even if you have high ping, is to stay at the middle corners of the pattern, giving you ample time to respond. If there are multiple people in the same section, <span style="color:#FF6666">MOVE IF 
            YOU'RE IN THE WAY. Pay attention to your allies. If ANYONE dies to this wheel, <span [style.color]='enemy.color'>Samael </span> <u>will heal by 15%</u>, which can potentially reset the wheel</span>, forcing you to do it over and over and over and over and over again.</p>
            <app-enemy-spell-display [caster]="enemy.name" [category]="enemy.category" [skills]="getSkills(skills[enemy.name], ['Purge%20of%20Light'])" style="width: 90%; align-self: center;"></app-enemy-spell-display>
            <p class="guide-description">
            <br>
            After his intermission, he will gain <span [style.color]='enemy.color'>Spirit of Light</span>, make sure he does not get healed by them, otherwise the fight is generally the same as the first phase. 
            At <span style="color:#90EE90">33% Max HP</span>, he'll use <span [style.color]='enemy.color'>Judgment</span> again. 
            However, its pretty much the same as last time. Don't let <span [style.color]='enemy.color'>Samael's</span> spells touch him and you'll kill him in no time.
